# Enhancing-Financial-Consumer-Satisfaction


## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Enhancing Financial Consumer Satisfaction through Advanced Text Classification and Predictive Analysis" project. The project aims to categorize consumer feedback on various financial products, providing meaningful insights and improving the precision and accuracy of complaint resolution.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective is to implement machine learning models for precise text classification. Specifically, we want to align consumer complaints with predefined categories corresponding to different financial product types. The goal is to streamline and automate the categorization process, leading to quicker response times to consumer feedback and improved overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
- **Size:** Approximately 700,000 rows and 18 columns.
- **Attributes:** Unique identifier ('Complaint ID'), financial product categories, associated issues, sub-issues, consumer narratives, company responses, and other relevant information.


## Tasks

### 1. Data Preparation
Clean, transform, and encode consumer complaint datasets for effective analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct in-depth analysis to uncover insights into variable relationships and their impact on complaint resolution.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Create novel features and transform existing ones to capture nuanced information, enhancing model predictive power.

### 4. Model Training
Develop and train supervised machine learning models using diverse algorithms and cutting-edge techniques.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using comprehensive evaluation metrics and robust validation techniques. Specifically, focus on F1-Score.

### 6. Model Optimization
Iteratively refine and optimize models to improve accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.

### 7. Predicting Future Complaint Resolutions
Apply developed models to new consumer complaint data to predict and categorize future complaint resolutions.
